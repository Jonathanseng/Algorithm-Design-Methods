// This code defines a genetic algorithm that can be used to find the best solution to a problem. The algorithm works by maintaining a population of chromosomes, which are potential solutions to the problem. The algorithm then repeatedly selects parents from the population, crosses them over to produce new children, and mutates some of the children. The algorithm continues this process until a stopping criterion is met, such as a certain number of generations have been completed or a chromosome with a fitness that is high enough has been found.

//The code also defines the functions crossover, mutate, and fitness_function. The crossover function takes two chromosomes as input and produces a new child chromosome. The mutate function takes a chromosome as input and randomly changes some of its bits. The fitness_function function takes a chromosome as input and returns a value that represents how good the chromosome is.

//The main function of the code runs the genetic algorithm and prints the best chromosome that it finds.

//To run the code, you can save it as a file called genetic_algorithm.rs and then run the following command in the terminal:
