There are many algorithms that have been built under the genetic algorithm. Here are a few examples:

* **TSP solver:** A TSP solver is an algorithm that can be used to find the shortest possible route between a set of cities. A genetic algorithm can be used to solve a TSP by representing each possible route as a chromosome and using the genetic operations of selection, crossover, and mutation to find the shortest route.
* **Job scheduling:** Job scheduling is the problem of finding the optimal order to run a set of jobs on a computer. A genetic algorithm can be used to solve a job scheduling problem by representing each possible order as a chromosome and using the genetic operations of selection, crossover, and mutation to find the order that will minimize the overall execution time.
* **Machine learning:** Genetic algorithms can be used to train machine learning models. For example, a genetic algorithm can be used to find the optimal weights for a neural network.
* **Image optimization:** Genetic algorithms can be used to optimize images. For example, a genetic algorithm can be used to find the optimal brightness, contrast, and saturation settings for an image.
* **Data mining:** Genetic algorithms can be used to mine data. For example, a genetic algorithm can be used to find patterns in data or to classify data.

These are just a few examples of algorithms that have been built under the genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithms can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, and new algorithms are being developed all the time.
