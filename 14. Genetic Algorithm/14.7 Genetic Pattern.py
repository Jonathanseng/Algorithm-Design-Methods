#This code first defines a function called genetic_algorithm(). This function takes two arguments: items and capacity. items is a list of items, where each item is a tuple of (value, weight). capacity is the capacity of the knapsack.

#The genetic_algorithm() function then works by iteratively improving the population of solutions. At each iteration, the function randomly selects two solutions from the population and then creates a new solution by combining the two solutions. The function then evaluates the new solution and keeps it if it is better than the old solution.

#The genetic_algorithm() function then returns the best solution that it finds.

#The evaluate_solution() function works by calculating the value of a solution. The value of a solution is the sum of the values of the items that are included in the solution.

#The main() function then calls the genetic_algorithm() function with the items and capacity. The main() function then prints the list of items that are included in the best solution.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as genetic_algorithm.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
