# This code first defines a function called knapsack(). This function takes two arguments: items and capacity. items is a list of items, where each item is a tuple of (value, weight). capacity is the capacity of the knapsack.

#The knapsack() function then works by creating a dynamic programming table. The dynamic programming table has one row for each item in the problem and one column for each possible capacity of the knapsack. The value of a cell in the table represents the maximum value that can be achieved by including the first i items in the knapsack if the capacity is j.

#The knapsack() function then fills the dynamic programming table using the following recursive formula:

# The knapsack() function then returns the list of items that are included in the knapsack by tracing back through the dynamic programming table.

#The main() function then calls the knapsack() function with the items and capacity. The main() function then prints the list of items that are included in the knapsack.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as knapsack.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
