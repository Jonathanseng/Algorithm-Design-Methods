# This code first defines a function called greedy_algorithm(). This function takes two arguments: items and capacity. items is a list of items, where each item is a tuple of (value, weight). capacity is the capacity of the knapsack.

#The greedy_algorithm() function then works by iterating through the list of items. For each item, it checks if the current weight of the knapsack plus the weight of the item is less than or equal to the capacity of the knapsack. If it is, then the item is included in the knapsack and the current weight of the knapsack is increased by the weight of the item.

#Once the loop has finished iterating through all of the items, the greedy_algorithm() function returns the list of items that are included in the knapsack.

#The main() function then calls the greedy_algorithm() function with the list of items and the capacity of the knapsack. The main() function then prints the list of items that are included in the knapsack.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as greedy_algorithm.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
