The data structures used to build the evolutionary algorithm depend on the specific problem being solved. However, some common data structures that are used include:

* **Lists:** Lists are a good choice for storing a population of solutions. This is because lists are easy to iterate through, and they can be easily modified.
* **Sets:** Sets are a good choice for storing a set of solutions. This is because sets are efficient at storing unique elements, and they can be easily searched.
* **Dictionaries:** Dictionaries are a good choice for storing a mapping between solutions and their fitness scores. This is because dictionaries are efficient at retrieving elements by key, and they can be easily sorted.

In addition to these common data structures, there are also a number of specialized data structures that can be used for evolutionary algorithms. For example, there are data structures that can be used to store a population of solutions in a way that facilitates efficient selection, crossover, and mutation.

The choice of which data structure to use depends on the specific problem being solved, and the performance requirements of the algorithm. For example, if the algorithm needs to be able to quickly iterate through the population of solutions, then a list might be a good choice. However, if the algorithm needs to be able to quickly retrieve elements by key, then a dictionary might be a better choice.

Here are some specific examples of how data structures are used in evolutionary algorithms:

* **Lists:** Lists are often used to store a population of solutions. For example, the Python code example that I provided uses a list to store the population of solutions.
* **Sets:** Sets are often used to store a set of solutions. For example, the Rust code example that I provided uses a set to store the set of solutions that have been visited.
* **Dictionaries:** Dictionaries are often used to store a mapping between solutions and their fitness scores. For example, the Python code example that I provided uses a dictionary to store the mapping between solutions and their fitness scores.

These are just a few examples of how data structures are used in evolutionary algorithms. Evolutionary algorithms are a powerful tool for finding good solutions to complex problems, and they can be used in a variety of ways.
