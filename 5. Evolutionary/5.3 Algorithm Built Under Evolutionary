There are many different algorithms that have been built under the evolutionary paradigm. Here are a few examples:

* **Genetic algorithms (GAs)** are one of the most well-known types of evolutionary algorithms. GAs use a process of selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve a population of candidate solutions.
* **Differential evolution (DE)** is another type of evolutionary algorithm that is often used for numerical optimization problems. DE uses a process of mutation, crossover, and selection to evolve a population of candidate solutions.
* **Particle swarm optimization (PSO)** is a type of evolutionary algorithm that is inspired by the behavior of flocks of birds or schools of fish. PSO uses a process of velocity updating and position updating to evolve a population of candidate solutions.
* **Simulated annealing (SA)** is a type of evolutionary algorithm that is based on the idea of simulated annealing in physics. SA uses a process of cooling and annealing to evolve a population of candidate solutions.

These are just a few examples of the many different algorithms that have been built under the evolutionary paradigm. Evolutionary algorithms are a powerful tool for finding good solutions to complex problems, and they are used in a wide variety of fields, including engineering, computer science, and finance.

Here are some specific examples of how evolutionary algorithms have been used to solve real-world problems:

* **Scheduling:** Evolutionary algorithms have been used to solve scheduling problems, such as the problem of finding a schedule for a set of tasks that minimizes the overall completion time.
* **Routing:** Evolutionary algorithms have been used to solve routing problems, such as the problem of finding the shortest path between a set of nodes.
* **Optimization:** Evolutionary algorithms have been used to solve optimization problems, such as the problem of finding the maximum value of a function subject to a set of constraints.
* **Machine learning:** Evolutionary algorithms have been used to train machine learning models, such as neural networks.

These are just a few examples of how evolutionary algorithms have been used to solve real-world problems. Evolutionary algorithms are a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.
