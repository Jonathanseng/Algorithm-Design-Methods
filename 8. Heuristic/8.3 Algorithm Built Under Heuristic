There are many algorithms that are built under the heuristic algorithm design. Here are some examples:

* **The greedy algorithm:** The greedy algorithm always chooses the next solution that is estimated to be the best. This algorithm is often used to solve problems where the goal is to minimize or maximize a certain quantity. For example, the greedy algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between two points in a graph.
* **The hill climbing algorithm:** The hill climbing algorithm starts with a random solution, and then it iteratively makes small changes to the solution in order to improve it. The algorithm continues until it reaches a solution that cannot be improved any further. For example, the hill climbing algorithm can be used to find the best way to pack a set of objects into a box.
* **The simulated annealing algorithm:** The simulated annealing algorithm is a stochastic algorithm that allows for some randomness in the search process. This algorithm is often used to solve problems where there are many local minima, and it can be more likely to find the global minimum than the greedy algorithm or the hill climbing algorithm. For example, the simulated annealing algorithm can be used to find the best way to configure a computer chip.
* **The genetic algorithm:** The genetic algorithm is a search algorithm that mimics the process of natural selection. This algorithm is often used to solve problems where there are many possible solutions, and it can be more likely to find the best solution than the greedy algorithm, the hill climbing algorithm, or the simulated annealing algorithm. For example, the genetic algorithm can be used to find the best way to design a new product.

These are just a few examples of algorithms that are built under the heuristic algorithm design. There are many other algorithms that use heuristics to find solutions to problems.

Heuristic algorithms are often used to solve problems that are difficult or impossible to solve using traditional algorithms. They can be very efficient at finding good solutions to problems, but they cannot guarantee that they will find the best solution.
