There are many algorithms that are built under the dynamic programming technique. Here are a few examples:

* **Longest common subsequence (LCS):** This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of two strings that is common to both strings.
* **Shortest path problem:** This algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
* **Knapsack problem:** This algorithm finds the most valuable subset of items that can fit into a knapsack with a limited weight capacity.
* **Dijkstra's algorithm:** This algorithm finds the shortest path between a source node and all other nodes in a graph.
* **Bellman-Ford algorithm:** This algorithm finds the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph.

These are just a few examples of algorithms that can be solved using dynamic programming. There are many other algorithms that can be solved using this technique, and it is a powerful tool for solving optimization problems.

Here are some of the benefits of using dynamic programming:

* **Efficiency:** Dynamic programming can be very efficient for problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
* **Flexibility:** Dynamic programming can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.
* **Powerful:** Dynamic programming can be used to solve some very difficult problems.

However, there are also some challenges associated with using dynamic programming:

* **Complexity:** Dynamic programming can be more complex than other programming techniques.
* **Data structures:** Dynamic programming often requires the use of large data structures, which can be a challenge for some applications.
* **Memory:** Dynamic programming can require a lot of memory, which can be a challenge for some applications.

Overall, dynamic programming is a powerful technique that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. However, it is important to be aware of the challenges associated with using this technique before using it in an application.
