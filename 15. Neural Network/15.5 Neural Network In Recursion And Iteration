Neural networks can be built using both recursion and iteration. The choice of which approach to use depends on the specific neural network architecture and the application.

**Recursion** is a method of solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller and smaller problems until they can be easily solved. This can be a useful approach for building neural networks with complex architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

**Iteration** is a method of solving a problem by repeating a set of steps until the solution is found. This can be a useful approach for building neural networks with simpler architectures, such as feedforward neural networks.

Here is an example of how a neural network can be built using recursion:

```
def build_neural_network(num_layers):
  if num_layers == 0:
    return Neuron()
  else:
    return Neuron(build_neural_network(num_layers - 1))
```

This function recursively builds a neural network with the specified number of layers. The function starts by creating a neuron. Then, it recursively calls itself to build the remaining layers of the neural network. The function stops recursing when the number of layers reaches 0.

Here is an example of how a neural network can be built using iteration:

```
def build_neural_network(num_layers):
  neural_network = []
  for i in range(num_layers):
    neural_network.append(Neuron())
  return neural_network
```

This function iteratively builds a neural network with the specified number of layers. The function starts by creating an empty list. Then, it iterates through the number of layers and creates a neuron for each layer. The function returns the list of neurons when the iteration is complete.

The choice of whether to use recursion or iteration to build a neural network depends on the specific neural network architecture and the application. Recursion can be a more efficient approach for building neural networks with complex architectures, while iteration can be a more efficient approach for building neural networks with simpler architectures.
