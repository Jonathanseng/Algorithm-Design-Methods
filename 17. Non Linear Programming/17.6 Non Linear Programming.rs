// This code defines a function called objective_function that takes a number as input and returns the value of the objective function at that point. The code also defines a function called constraint_function that takes a number as input and returns the value of the constraint function at that point.

//The code then defines a function called solve_nlp that uses a gradient descent algorithm to find the solution to the nonlinear programming problem. The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the solution, and then repeatedly updates the guess by moving in the direction of the negative gradient of the objective function until the gradient is less than a certain tolerance.

//The code finally defines a main function that calls the solve_nlp function and prints the solution to the console.

//To run this code, you can save it as a file called nlp.rs and then run the following command in the terminal:
