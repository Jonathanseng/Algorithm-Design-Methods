# This algorithm works by starting with an initial solution and then iteratively making changes to it in order to find a better solution. The changes are made to the solution in a way that preserves the overall structure of the solution, so that the algorithm does not get stuck in local minima.

#The algorithm terminates when no better solution can be found. The best solution found by the algorithm is returned.

#The local_search function implements the local search algorithm iteratively. The local_search_recursive function implements the local search algorithm recursively.

#The neighborhood_function takes a solution as input and returns a set of neighboring solutions. The objective_function takes a solution as input and returns its objective value.

#The local_search and local_search_recursive functions both return the best solution found by the local search algorithm. The local_search function iterates through the neighborhood of the current solution, while the local_search_recursive function recursively searches the neighborhood of the current solution.
