The data structure used in local search algorithm design depends on the specific problem being solved. However, some common data structures that are used include:

* **Graphs:** Graphs are a good data structure for representing problems where the solution can be represented as a set of nodes and edges. For example, the traveling salesman problem can be represented as a graph, where each node represents a city and each edge represents the distance between two cities.
* **Lists:** Lists are a good data structure for representing problems where the solution can be represented as a sequence of elements. For example, the knapsack problem can be represented as a list, where each element represents an item and the value of each element represents the weight and value of the item.
* **Sets:** Sets are a good data structure for representing problems where the solution can be represented as a collection of unique elements. For example, the bin packing problem can be represented as a set, where each element represents an item and the value of each element represents the size of the item.

In addition to these common data structures, other data structures may be used depending on the specific problem being solved. For example, the A* algorithm uses a priority queue to store the unvisited nodes in the search space, sorted by their estimated cost to the goal.

The data structure used in local search algorithm design should be able to efficiently store and access the information about the search space and the solutions that have been explored. The data structure should also be able to efficiently generate new solutions from existing solutions.

Here are some additional considerations when choosing a data structure for local search algorithm design:

* The size of the search space: If the search space is large, then a data structure that can efficiently store and access a large number of elements is needed.
* The number of solutions to be explored: If a large number of solutions need to be explored, then a data structure that can efficiently generate new solutions from existing solutions is needed.
* The time constraints: If the algorithm needs to find a solution within a certain amount of time, then a data structure that can efficiently search the search space is needed.
