There are a number of algorithms that have been built under the integer programming framework. Some of the most common algorithms include:

* **Branch-and-bound:** This algorithm is a general-purpose algorithm for solving integer programming problems. It works by repeatedly branching the problem into smaller and smaller subproblems. Each subproblem is solved to optimality, and the best solution found so far is kept track of. The algorithm terminates when no more subproblems can be branched or when the best solution found so far is optimal.
* **Cutting plane:** This algorithm works by solving the linear relaxation of the integer programming problem. The linear relaxation is a problem where the integer constraints are relaxed to allow for continuous values. The algorithm then adds cutting planes to the linear relaxation, which are inequalities that are satisfied by all integer solutions to the original problem but not by all continuous solutions. The cutting planes are added one at a time, and the linear relaxation is solved again after each cut is added. The algorithm terminates when the linear relaxation is infeasible or when the best solution found so far is optimal.
* **Mixed integer programming:** This algorithm is a special case of branch-and-bound that is designed for problems with mixed integer variables. Mixed integer variables are variables that can take on either an integer or a continuous value. The algorithm works by branching on the integer variables and solving the continuous subproblems to optimality.
* **Heuristics:** Heuristics are algorithms that are designed to find good solutions to integer programming problems quickly. Heuristics are often used for problems that are too difficult to solve using other methods.

The choice of algorithm for a particular integer programming problem will depend on the specific problem and the resources available. For example, branch-and-bound is a powerful algorithm that can be used to solve a wide variety of integer programming problems, but it can be slow for large problems. Cutting plane algorithms are often used for problems where the linear relaxation can be solved quickly. Mixed integer programming algorithms are often used for problems with a large number of mixed integer variables. Heuristics can be used for problems that are too difficult to solve using other methods.

Integer programming is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. However, it is important to note that integer programming problems can be difficult to solve, and there is no guarantee that an optimal solution can be found.
