// Integer programming in Rust can be solved using a variety of libraries, including:

  //  good_lp: This library provides a simple API for modeling and solving integer programming problems.
   // lp-modeler: This library provides a more powerful API for modeling and solving integer programming problems.
   // highs: This library is a high-performance solver for integer programming problems.

//To use one of these libraries, you will need to first install it using the cargo package manager. Once the library is installed, you can use it to model and solve your integer programming problem.

//Here is an example of how to solve a knapsack problem using the good_lp library:

use good_lp::{Model, Problem, Solver};

fn main() {
  // Create a model
  let mut model = Model::new();

  // Add variables
  let x = model.add_var(true);
  let y = model.add_var(true);

  // Add constraints
  model.add_constraint(x + y <= 1);
  model.add_constraint(x * 100 + y * 200 <= 1000);

  // Set the objective function
  model.set_objective(x * 100 + y * 200);

  // Solve the problem
  let solver = Solver::new();
  let solution = solver.solve(&model);

  // Print the solution
  println!("x = {}", solution[x]);
  println!("y = {}", solution[y]);
}

// This code first creates a model and adds two variables, x and y. The code then adds two constraints, one that says that x + y <= 1 and one that says that x * 100 + y * 200 <= 1000. The code then sets the objective function to x * 100 + y * 200. Finally, the code solves the problem using the Solver library and prints the solution.

//The good_lp library also provides a number of other features, such as the ability to solve mixed integer programming problems and the ability to solve problems with multiple objectives.

//The lp-modeler library provides a more powerful API for modeling and solving integer programming problems. It allows you to define your own problem types and it provides a number of additional features, such as the ability to solve problems with non-linear constraints.

//The highs library is a high-performance solver for integer programming problems. It is designed to be used for large-scale problems and it can solve problems that other libraries cannot.

//The choice of which library to use will depend on the specific problem you are trying to solve and the resources available. For example, if you are solving a small problem, you may want to use the good_lp library because it is easy to use. If you are solving a large-scale problem, you may want to use the highs library because it is more efficient.
