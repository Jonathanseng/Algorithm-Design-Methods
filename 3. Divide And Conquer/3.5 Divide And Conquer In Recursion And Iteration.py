# The divide and conquer approach can be implemented using recursion or iteration.

# Recursion: In recursion, the problem is broken down into smaller subproblems, and each subproblem is solved recursively. The base cases are simple problems that can be solved directly. The recursive calls are made on the subproblems, and the solutions to the subproblems are combined to solve the original problem.

# Iteration: In iteration, the problem is broken down into smaller subproblems, and each subproblem is solved iteratively. The base cases are simple problems that can be solved directly. The iterative steps are used to solve the subproblems, and the solutions to the subproblems are combined to solve the original problem.

# Here is an example of how to build a divide and conquer algorithm to find the maximum element in an array using recursion:

def max_element_recursive(array):
  """
  Finds the maximum element in the array.

  Args:
    array: The array to search.

  Returns:
    The maximum element in the array.
  """

  if len(array) == 1:
    return array[0]

  mid = len(array) // 2
  max_left = max_element_recursive(array[:mid])
  max_right = max_element_recursive(array[mid:])

  return max(max_left, max_right)


def main():
  """
  The main function.

  Prints the maximum element in the array.
  """

  array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  print(max_element_recursive(array))


if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()

# This code first defines a function called max_element_recursive() that takes an array as input. The function then recursively divides the array in half and finds the maximum element in each half. The maximum of the two maximum elements is then returned.

#The main function then creates an array and calls the max_element_recursive() function on the array. The function prints the maximum element in the array.

#Here is an example of how to build a divide and conquer algorithm to find the maximum element in an array using iteration:

def max_element_iterative(array):
  """
  Finds the maximum element in the array.

  Args:
    array: The array to search.

  Returns:
    The maximum element in the array.
  """

  max_element = array[0]
  for element in array[1:]:
    if element > max_element:
      max_element = element

  return max_element


def main():
  """
  The main function.

  Prints the maximum element in the array.
  """

  array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  print(max_element_iterative(array))


if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()

# This code first defines a function called max_element_iterative() that takes an array as input. The function then iterates through the array and keeps track of the maximum element. The maximum element is then returned.

#The main function then creates an array and calls the max_element_iterative() function on the array. The function prints the maximum element in the array.

#Both the recursive and iterative approaches can be used to build divide and conquer algorithms. The choice of approach depends on the specific problem and the programmer's preference.
