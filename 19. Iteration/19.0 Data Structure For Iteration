The data structure for the iteration would be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents one time zone. The dictionary would have the following keys:

* **name:** The name of the time zone.
* **abbreviation:** The abbreviation of the time zone.
* **offset:** The offset of the time zone from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

For example, the data structure for the iteration could be:

```python
time_zones = [
    {
        "name": "កម្ពុជា",
        "abbreviation": "ICT",
        "offset": "+07"
    },
    {
        "name": "Pacific Standard Time",
        "abbreviation": "PST",
        "offset": "-08"
    },
    {
        "name": "Central European Time",
        "abbreviation": "CET",
        "offset": "+01"
    }
]
```

To iterate through the list of time zones, you could use a for loop:

```python
for time_zone in time_zones:
    print(time_zone["name"])
```

This would print the name of each time zone in the list.
