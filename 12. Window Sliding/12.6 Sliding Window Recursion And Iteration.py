def max_sliding_window_recursive(data, window_size):
    if len(data) < window_size:

    return [max(data[i:i + window_size]) for i in range(len(data) - window_size + 1)]

# This code first checks if the length of the data is less than the window size. If it is, then it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns a list of the maximum values of each sliding window. The sliding window is calculated by starting at the beginning of the data and moving forward by the window size. The maximum value of each sliding window is then calculated and added to the list.

def max_sliding_window_iterative(data, window_size):
    maximum_values = []
    current_window = data[:window_size]
    maximum_values.append(max(current_window))
    for i in range(window_size, len(data)):
        current_window = current_window[1:] + [data[i]]
        maximum_values.append(max(current_window))
    return maximum_values

# This code first initializes the maximum values list to an empty list. Then, it initializes the current window to the first window size elements of the data. The maximum value of the current window is then added to the maximum values list. Next, it iterates over the data starting from the window size element. For each element, it removes the oldest element from the current window and adds the new element to the current window. The maximum value of the current window is then added to the maximum values list. Finally, the maximum values list is returned.

# Both of these codes work by maintaining a sliding window of the data. The difference is that the recursive code uses recursion to calculate the maximum value of each sliding window, while the iterative code uses a loop to calculate the maximum value of each sliding window.
