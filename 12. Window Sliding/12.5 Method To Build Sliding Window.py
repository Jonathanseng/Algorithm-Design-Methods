#Define the window size. The window size is the number of elements that will be included in the window.
#Initialize the window. The window can be initialized to an empty list or an array.
#Iterate over the data. For each element in the data, do the following:
#Add the element to the window.
#If the window is full, remove the oldest element from the window.
#Perform the desired operation on the window.
#After iterating over the data, the sliding window will contain the results of the desired operation.
#Here is an example of how to build a sliding window to find the maximum value in a stream of data:

def max_sliding_window(data, window_size):
    maximum_values = []
    current_window = []
    for element in data:
        current_window.append(element)
        if len(current_window) > window_size:
            current_window.pop(0)
        maximum_values.append(max(current_window))
    return maximum_values

# This code first defines the window size (4). Then, it initializes the current window to an empty list. Next, it iterates over the data and adds each element to the current window. If the current window is full, it removes the oldest element from the window. Finally, it appends the maximum value of the current window to the maximum values list. The maximum values list will contain the maximum values of the sliding window at each step.

#This is just one example of how to build a sliding window. The specific implementation will vary depending on the specific problem that is being solved.
